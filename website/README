Hello!

This README is intended for people who want to modify
http://coffeehousecoders.org.

To get your changes on the live site, send a diff to
startup@coffeehousecoders.org. We're a pretty friendly bunch. : )


Here are the files you probably care about:

    - app.yaml: Lets App Engine know where to find static content

    - main.py: Go here to add/modify pages on the site. Each page is a
        class that inherits from BaseRequestClass, and routed at the bottom of
        the file. There are plenty of examples to follow in the file. Note you
        only need to include the "inner" HTML, the "outer" HTML comes from
        templates/base_page.html.

    - static/*: CSS and images for the site

    - templates/base_page.html: HTML for header, nav bar, activity feed, footer


Obviously, there is more code to the site, hopefully it'll be documented better
in future versions.
