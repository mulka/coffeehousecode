# what is coffeehousecoders? #

Whether you're new to coding or a seasoned hacker, you've got your own pet project, or you want to check out what other people are doing, coffeehousecoders is for you. We meet once a week to bang out code, swap code snippets, talk about the latest and greatest in software, and bounce around ideas.

# when do we meet? #

Every week on Wednesday from 9pm to 11pm, we gather at a coffeeshop in Ann Arbor, MI (usually Mujo's in the Duderstadt Center on North Campus). You can also join us from anywhere in the world on our IRC channel.

Be sure to link up with people before and after the event on Facebook. You can also sign up for the weekly email reminders on the email list(sign up at http://coffeehousecoders.org).
We will take over the world.
